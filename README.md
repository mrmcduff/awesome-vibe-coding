## Introduction

Vibe coding is a term introduced by Andrej Karpathy in February 2025, describing a coding approach that relies heavily on AI language models. Instead of manually writing code line by line, developers provide natural language descriptions and let AI generate the actual code. This approach has been gaining significant traction, enabling both technical and non-technical users to build software with minimal coding knowledge.
